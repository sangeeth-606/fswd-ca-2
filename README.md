Build a **Student Management System** using **React** that displays a list of students, allows users to add new students, and renders each student dynamically.  

---

## 📌 **Expected Functionality & Output**  

### 🔹 **Student List**  
- A page should display a student list containing students with their **name, age, and grade**.  
- Example UI output:  
  ```  
  Student List  
  ----------------------  
  🎓 Alice - Age: 20 - Grade: A  
  🎓 Bob - Age: 22 - Grade: B  
  🎓 Charlie - Age: 21 - Grade: A-  
  ```  
- The list should dynamically render based on available students.  

---

### 🔹 **Student Item**  
- Each student should be displayed as a separate entry with:  
  - **Student Name**  
  - **Age**  
  - **Grade**  

- Example individual output:  
  ```  
  🎓 Alice - Age: 20 - Grade: A  
  ```  

---

### 🔹 **Student Form**  
- The page should have a form allowing users to add **new students** to the student list.  
- The form should contain input fields for:  
  - Student Name  
  - Age (Number input)  
  - Grade (Dropdown: A, B, C, etc.)  
- A **Submit Button** should be present.  
- On clicking submit, the inputted values should be captured.  

---

## 📌 **Technical Constraints**  
- The project must be built using **React components**.  
- Components should be structured properly.  
- Styling should be applied for **better readability and UI consistency**.  

---

### **Instructions for Students**  

- Complete `StudentForm.jsx` by adding:  
    - An input field for the **student name**.  
    - A number input for **age**.  
    - A dropdown for selecting **grade**.  
    - A **Submit button** to add the student.  
- Ensure students are displayed in the `StudentList` component.  
- Use the appropriate method in `StudentList.jsx` to render each student dynamically.  
- The UI should be styled for **better readability**.  

---

## 📌 **Submission Guidelines**  
- Save your code, **compress the project folder**, and upload it for submission.  
- Ensure that `node_modules` is **excluded** from the submission.  

Happy Coding! 🚀
